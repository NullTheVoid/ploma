TODO
------------------------------

Wednesday:
- watch Ryan Lester's work videos

Plane:
- think through demo for all-hands
  - capturing the humanity of touch
  - not trying to generalize, because that doesn't make sense for something as sensitive as touch
  - instead focusing as much as possible on: one person, one touch, one pen, one paper, one ink
  - to see what that approach is like, and if that's what is takes?
  - maybe drawing software on the market could use more calibration?
  - ballpoint is lubricated, and smooth, friction matters
  - being 'accurate' is not enough, what does 'accurate' mean
  - have to depend on irregularites in both touch and vision

Later:
- add time sensitivity to replay
- use Scratch curve fitting via radio option
- optimize curve fitting as you go

Later Later:
- write 'output' button/functionality for replay to output panel values
- figure out MVVM solution for panel code

------------------------------
RENDERING
------------------------------

- non-linear rendering of darkness
  - based on time/speed
  - based on pressure
  - based on visual comparison
- non-linear application of pressure
  - based on time/speed
  - based on visual comparison
- non-linear rendering of thickness
  - based on time/speed
  - based on pressure
  - based on visual comparison
- non-linear application of alpha blending
  - based on intersections?
  - based on pressure?
- misc
  - spattering of ink on paper?
  - ink blots? => okay to be randomly lookup?

------------------------------
OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------

- only use curve fitting when there are too many points?
- only use curve fitting when there are not enough points?
- if time is fast, then don't optimize
- if time is slow and there are many points, optimize
- others??
