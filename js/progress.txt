Discoveries so far:

- A little texture goes a long way.
- Curve fitting depends on speed, area of curve, and number of points.

Texture:

- Must offset the texture within the canvas so the offset into the
texture is not "wallpapered" but randomized instead.
Adding a little extra randomization doesn't hurt.

- Transparent textures with only black/blue pixels and transparent
otherwise is the best for the alpha blending, this way the more you write
the darker it gets, but there are no light pixels to obscure darker pixels
underneath.  That being said, it's difficult to get thin, sparse dark
lines with a transparent texture, so have to continue playing with
switching textures in and out.

- Still need to focus on how the texture looks for very light lines.

Alpha:

- Simulating ink dispersal and catching is very effective.  Having the pen run
out of ink sometimes, especially when the pen has just gone down, is very
effective.  This is easiest done on the fly, calculating the time as we
go, or with a timer.

Curve Fitting:

- Need to collect lots of sample data to see which amount of curve
fitting downsampling works for which speeds, areas and number of points.
I have isolated a good compromise for handwriting by AK and EE, but need
to collect more types of data to build up that lookup table.
