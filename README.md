What happens when you design a drawing app aimed at emulating a single type of paper, a single type of pen and a single user's writing?  
  
Too often software is designed generally, robustly, to work for everyone.  
  
Art and expression don't really work that way.  Expressive language comes from the individual, so this is an app to explore how sketching software on a tablet can be more 'accurate' in the expressive sense.
