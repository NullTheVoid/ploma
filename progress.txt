	- need smoother curves: Bezier tangent?
	- need to be able to resize the texture
		- for width calculations
		- for grain
	- need to not have to scale down in the browser
	- need to add antialiasing
		- to reduce jaggies
	- will texturing/alpha and antialiasing interfere?
	- should resizing mean touching footprints of different sizes?
	- how does footprint and width of line relate?

The tools in the WILL SDK can be texture or color filled.  If texture filled, then the texture can be shaped, and randomized and scattered according to some linear algorithms,  No table look up from what I can tell.

- what does the speed path builder do?
	- how are width and alpha configured depending on speed?
- what does the pressure path builder do?
	- how are width and alpha configured depending on pressure?

- last week at EyeO tested with illustrators, found out
  - that my system worked well for penmanship but not so well for drawing (see Liz's cat drawing)
  - drawings feel very flat, she wanted more blobs and unflattening
  - that I need to add more table lookups and deal with the edge cases (very heavy and very light pressure)
  - in order to do more testing, need to get optimization and rendering on the fly working
  - capture/replay workflow is too disruptive for effective testing
- retina screen will show very thin lines better, especially rendering twice the size and shrinking (Kyle McDonald)
- WILL is using asm.js and is still slow on Cintiq HD13, will ask them if performance is better on the bigger tablets
- WILL code is very tightly bound to the UI, which is unfortunate, so I have to spend time teasing them apart for my own app


- what does a smoother do?

TODO
------------------------------

- The texture really 'reveals' itself on very long lines.  Need a way
to make that look more organic even still.  This is not a problem for
shorter curves with less points.

- Need to adjust curve fitting a bit depending on more finetuned versions
of area covered and speed

- Need to collect lots of sample data to see which amount of curve
fitting downsampling works for which speeds, areas and number of points.
I have isolated a good compromise for handwriting by AK and EE, but need
to collect more types of data to build up that lookup table.

- For pressures close to 1, make the texture darker (same color but darker).

Lessons
------------------------------

Texture
-------

- A little texture goes a long way.

- Must offset the texture within the canvas so the texture is not "wallpapered"
but randomized instead. Adding a little extra randomization doesn't hurt.

- Textures with monochrome/variable-transparency pixels 
are the best for alpha blending, this way the more you write
the darker it gets, but there are no light pixels to obscure darker pixels
underneath.

Alpha
-----

- Simulating ink dispersal and catching is very effective.  Having the pen "run
out of ink" sometimes, especially when the pen has just gone down, is very
effective.  This is easiest done on the fly, calculating the time as we
go, or with a timer.

Curve Fitting
-------------

- Curve fitting depends on speed, area of curve, and number of points.
- Curve fitting might come down to a lookup-table approach, too for certain speeds.


Color
-----

- Ballpoint pen ink changes in hue perceptibly depending on lightness of touch.
A very light touch looks very blue, a medium touch looks gray/blue, a dark
touch looks black.  I need to use various darknesses of the same hue to 
achieve this variation and swap textures in and out.  A single texture can't
achieve the range.

Anti-aliasing
-------------

- HTML5 <canvas> antialiasing is automatic and handled by the browser.
After experimenting with three browsers with antialising thin lines:
Chrome is best
Safari and Firefox are similar, and not as good.

- For thin lines, making them dark causes the antialiasing to weaken and jaggies appear.
If we want thin, dark lines (for less pressure or when, precisely?) then a good combination
is a darkish-texture combined with a small canvas-applied shadow to hide the jaggies.

- Best RGB so far: 45, 43, 98
- Best PNG so far: PencilTextures2_8sm_transparent6_sm17
