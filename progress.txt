TODO
------------------------------

- The texture really 'reveals' itself on very long lines.  Need a way
to make that look more organic even still.  This is not a problem for
shorter curves with less points.

- Need to adjust curve fitting a bit depending on more finetuned versions
of area covered and speed

- Need to collect lots of sample data to see which amount of curve
fitting downsampling works for which speeds, areas and number of points.
I have isolated a good compromise for handwriting by AK and EE, but need
to collect more types of data to build up that lookup table.

- For pressures close to 1, make the texture darker (same color but darker).

Lessons

Texture
-------

- A little texture goes a long way.

- Must offset the texture within the canvas so the texture is not "wallpapered"
but randomized instead. Adding a little extra randomization doesn't hurt.

- Textures with monochrome/variable-transparency pixels 
are the best for alpha blending, this way the more you write
the darker it gets, but there are no light pixels to obscure darker pixels
underneath.

Alpha
-----

- Simulating ink dispersal and catching is very effective.  Having the pen "run
out of ink" sometimes, especially when the pen has just gone down, is very
effective.  This is easiest done on the fly, calculating the time as we
go, or with a timer.

Curve Fitting
-------------

- Curve fitting depends on speed, area of curve, and number of points.
- Curve fitting might come down to a lookup-table approach, too for certain speeds.


Color
-----

- Ballpoint pen ink changes in hue perceptibly depending on lightness of touch.
A very light touch looks very blue, a medium touch looks gray/blue, a dark
touch looks black.  I need to use various darknesses of the same hue to 
achieve this variation and swap textures in and out.  A single texture can't
achieve the range.
